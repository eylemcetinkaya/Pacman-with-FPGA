# Pacman-with-FPGA
This project uses vivado Xilinx and BASYS3 for a basic pacman game. This repo consists of 6 sub modules and 1 main module called birlestirme. It is a single level and based on a 9x9 map.Unfortunately, there is no winning mechanism because this game was made in only 2 weeks by a single person.
